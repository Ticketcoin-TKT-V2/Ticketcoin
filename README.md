TICKETCOIN - THE RELAUNCH OF VERSION 2
===========================

Ticketcoin, which operated under the ticker TKT was originally launched as a POW coin with unique lotto-mining features which allowed miners to decide whether to straight mine the coin; or mine on a lotto system where the odds of finding a "winning" block was much lower (roughly 1 in 50) however the payout yielded a 100x payout on the found block. 

This feature; which had never before been implemented; garnered decent attention among altcoin enthusiasts and miners alike. 

On June 20th, the final node went offline.
